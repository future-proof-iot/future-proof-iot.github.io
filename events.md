## 27.08.2019: IETF steps towards authenticated key exchange for OSCORE

A new working group called [LAKE](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/lake/about/)(Lightweight Authenticated Key Exchange) is being chartered in the IETF aiming to design a [key exchange](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-selander-lake-reqs) protocol for OSCORE. OSCORE is an application-layer protection mechanism for CoAP used in 6TiSCH networks. The LAKE outcome is important for RIOT-fp as one of our objectives is to design a zero-touch secure joining protocol for Internet of Things networks, with dependency on both OSCORE and LAKE.
